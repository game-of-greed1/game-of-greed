# Lab: Game of Greed 1

## This game appears to be a slight variation on farkle. The main difference is that in Greed a player's score is banked when they have (what in farkle is called) hot dice, so they don't risk it in rolling a fresh set of six dice. All of the other scoring and play characteristics fall within the range of variations reported for farkle. Also, the article is rather sloppy and has some grammatical errors. Given all that, one could argue for deleting with a redirect to farkle, as long as slight changes are made to the farkle page acknowledging greed as a name for a variant in which scores are not risked in throwing hot dice. Any thoughts on this?
